# Model Editing

Model editing involves creating or modifying the 3D file formats in the game. Most model editors for the game are written as **Blender** AddOns, and this is by far the most common model editor used for the game.

Model editing is itself often split into the following categories:

- Static Models (M2): Smaller game objects, props, items **(Easy)**
- Map Objects (WMO): Houses, caves, capitals **(Medium-Hard)**
- Animated Models (M2): Creatures, Player models, spells, boats. **(Hard)**

Static models and map objects have relatively mature workflows, while animated models is still highly experimental and often requires expert knowledge or very specialized tools to do successfully.

Model editors often show proficiency in:
- 3D modeling in Blender
- Knowledge of the basic 3D model formats used by the game, their features and limitations.
- Problem solving, because things can easily go wrong.
