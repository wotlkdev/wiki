# Your First: Model Edit (UNFINISHED)

This guide will teach you the very basics of customizing 3D models in Blender using the WoW Blender Studio Addon.

We will learn how to:
- Set up WoW Blender Studio
- Make a minor modification to a WMO file
- Make a minor modification to a static M2 file

## Theory: M2 and WMO files

Before we start setting up our extension, we need to understand the two basic file formats used to represent 3D models in WoW.

- **m2** - The most common format for 3D models in the game, used for "smaller" models, both animated and non-animated.
    - [Longer dicusssion](../theory/m2)
    - [Technical details](https://wowdev.wiki/M2)

- **wmo** - Used for larger structures like houses, caves, bridges and even capitals like Stormwind and Orgrimmar.

## Learning to use Blender

Since most model editing for WoW is with Blender, this tutorial will assume you understand Blender basics, like navigating the 3D viewport and editing vertices.

You can learn Blender from here:
- Blender Guru
- [[Add more here]]

You can skip these topics entirely:
- Rendering

For the purpose of trying out WBS, these sections are also not strictly necessary but might be useful for the future:
- UV unwrapping
- Texture editing
- Sculpting
- Scripting
- Material Editor

## WoW Blender Studio (WBS) (NOT WRITTEN YET)

We haven't had the time to write this guide yet, but there is a really good guide on [model-changing.net](https://model-changing.net/index.php?app=tutorials&module=tutorials&controller=view&id=164) for getting started.
